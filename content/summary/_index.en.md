In this workshop, we leveraged the AWS Amplify tools and libraries to very quickly build and deploy a Next.js application with authentication. This illustrates how teams can quickly develop applications, including the necessary backend components, and deploy them in the cloud. You should now have the tools and knowledge to begin experimenting with other capabilities of Amplify to further enhance your application with features such as real-time updates, analytics, messaging, chat bots, and more!
