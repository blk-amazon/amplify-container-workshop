In this workshop, weâ€™re going to build a simple blogging application using Next.js and Amplify to provide both a Server-Side Rendered (SSR) as well as Static Site Generated solution. This application will highlight the ease of developing features such as Authentication and Real-Time Subscriptions using Amplify as well as levaraging Amplify's container-based hosting functionality to then host our application in a container on AWS Fargate. Lastly, we will look at how we can use AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy to provide continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for our application, including automatic rollbacks and blue/green support. This workshop should take approximately 6 hours to complete.
