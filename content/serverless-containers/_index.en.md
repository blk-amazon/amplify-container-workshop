Serverless containers provide the ability for you to deploy APIs and host websites using AWS Fargate. Customers with existing applications or those who require a lower level of control can bring Docker containers and deploy them into an Amplify project fully integrating with other resources.

Amplify libraries can be used with the Auth category giving mobile and web applications secure connectivity and access controls to your Serverless containers. Additionally, existing GraphQL and REST services such as AWS AppSync and Amazon API Gateway can be used in the same project along with Fargate-backed APIs giving flexibility to mix and match for cost optimization and operational needs.
